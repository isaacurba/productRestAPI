# Backend REST API — README

Small, simple README for the backend portion of the REST API assignment.

## Project
A lightweight Node.js/Express REST API for the assignment. Provides endpoints to create, read, update and delete resources and includes basic validation and error handling.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ (or newer)
- npm or yarn
- Optional: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (if the project uses a database)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and open the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd /C:/Users/URBAN\ KPOMASSI\ B/Documents/PLPspecialization/RestApiAssignment/backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```
3. Copy and edit environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Example .env entries:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

## Running
Start the server:
```bash
npm run start
# or for development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```
The server will run on the port defined in .env (default 3000).

## Common scripts
- npm run start — start production server
- npm run dev — start dev server with nodemon
- npm run test — run tests
- npm run lint — run linter/format checks

## API (example)
- GET /health — health check
- GET /api/items — list items
- GET /api/items/:id — get item
- POST /api/items — create item
- PUT /api/items/:id — update item
- DELETE /api/items/:id — delete item

Include authentication headers or required payloads as documented in the implementation files.

## Tests
Run unit/integration tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Contributing
- Follow existing code style and lint rules
- Write tests for new features
- Open PRs with a clear description and related issue (if any)
